# 🚀 Getting Started with Gemini + Fetch.ai

Welcome to the Gemini + Fetch.ai Quick Start Guides! This repository contains everything you need to build powerful AI agents for the Google Gemini hackathon.

## 📋 What's Included

### ✅ Complete Guide 1: Basic Gemini Agent
**Location:** `01-basic-gemini-agent/`

A fully functional conversational AI agent that you can deploy in 10 minutes!

**What it includes:**

2. Review `basic_gemini_agent.py`
3. Check `ARCHITECTURE.md` for system design
4. Customize using `CUSTOMIZATION.md`
5. Deploy and iterate

### Path 3: Hackathon Speedrun

2. Copy `basic_gemini_agent.py`
3. Add your key to `.env`
4. Run: `python basic_gemini_agent.py`
5. Deploy to Agentverse
6. Start building your unique features!

## 🏆 Hackathon Success Tips

### For the Fetch.ai Challenge

Your agent needs to:
✅ Use Google Gemini API
✅ Deploy to Agentverse
✅ Be discoverable on ASI One
✅ Demonstrate innovation

**Winning strategies:**
1. **Solve a Real Problem** - Don't just chat, add value
2. **Show Multimodal Power** - Use images, not just text
3. **Add Actions with MCPs** - Make it do things
4. **Polish the UX** - Great experience = better demos
5. **Document Well** - Help judges understand your vision

### Unique Ideas to Stand Out

**Instead of generic chatbots, try:**
- 🏥 Health symptom checker (with image analysis)
- 📊 Data visualization agent (upload data, get charts)
- 🎨 Creative assistant (image + text generation)
- 🔍 Research helper (searches, summarizes, analyzes)
- 🏗️ Code reviewer (analyzes code, suggests improvements)
- 🌐 Translation agent (text + image translation)
- 📚 Learning tutor (adaptive, multimodal lessons)
- 🎮 Game master (interactive storytelling)
